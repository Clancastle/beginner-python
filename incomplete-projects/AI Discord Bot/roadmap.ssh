Defining the Purpose
1. Answer some basic questions, maybe incorporate chatgpt
- play some basic games, moderate server to some extent, - block sexual innuendo
- some games would be - blackjack; roll; rock,p,s ; maybe generate out of context phrases, completley stupid
(check)

2. DEv environment, set up.
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Create a new directory for your project and set up a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- set up. (check)

3. discord api, bot token
Create a Discord account if you don't have one already.
Then, follow the Discord developer documentation to create a new bot application and obtain the bot token.
This token will be required to authenticate your bot with the Discord API.

4. Choose library
There are several Python libraries to interact with the Discord API.
Some popular ones are discord.py, discord.py-rewrite, and discord.py-next.
Choose one that suits your needs and has good community support.
discord.py (check)

5. Functionality
Set up your bot to log in using the token, connect to your Discord server,
and respond to basic commands. For example, make it reply to a specific command like !hello with a greeting.

6. implement AI capability
To add AI capabilities, you can integrate a natural language processing (NLP) model or a chatbot model.
One option is to use the Hugging Face Transformers library, which provides pre-trained language models.
GPT-3 is an example of a powerful language model, but you might also start with a smaller model like GPT-2.

7. Train+ Fine Tune
If you choose a pre-trained model, you might need to fine-tune it on a custom dataset that fits your specific bot's purpose.
Alternatively, you can use the model directly and fine-tune it over time based on user interactions.

8. Deploy
Popular options for hosting include Heroku, AWS, and DigitalOcean.

9. Handle Errors, Exceptions
Make your bot robust by handling errors and exceptions gracefully. Ensure that it doesn't crash or become unresponsive
if it encounters unexpected situations.

10. Test and Repeat
Test your bot thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
Consider user feedback to improve the bot's functionality and responses.

11. Monitor, Maintain
After deployment, monitor your bot's performance and usage.
Be prepared to update and maintain it as needed, especially if Discord API changes or your bot's AI model requires updates.
